### Get locatable object by ehr_uri [GET /link{?ehr_uri,ehr_id}]
openEHR EHR-URIs are described in `http://www.openehr.org/releases/BASE/latest/docs/architecture_overview/architecture_overview.html#_ehr_uris`
openEHR EHR-URIs can point to any object that inherit from the openEHR `LOCATABLE` class

openEHR EHR-URIs can be either `absolute EHR-URIs` like

            `ehr:/347a5490-55ee-4da9-b91a-9bba710f730e/compositions/87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B/content[openEHR-EHR-SECTION.vital_signs.v1]/items[openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.heart_rate-pulse.v1]/data/events[at0006, 'any event']/data/items[at0004]`

or `relative EHR-URIs` - relative to the "current" ehr:

            `ehr:compositions/87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B/content[openEHR-EHR-SECTION.vital_signs.v1]/items[openEHR-EHR-OBSERVATION.blood_pressure.v1]/data/events[at0006, 'any event']/data/items[at0004]`

If the http header `openEHR-EHR-id` is present in the request, it MUST contain a single openEHR `ehr_id`.
Clients SHOULD send the `openEHR-EHR-id` header if they know that the query concerns only a specific EHR.
The presence of such a header MAY be used by the server to restrict querying to only the identified EHR, and it MAY also be used by the server to route (e.g. in sharded scale-out systems) based on ehr_id

    + Headers

            openEHR-EHR-id: fc334f45-ffb7-4077-8134-4d3d5e6cb2a1

    + Parameters 
        + ehr_uri  (string) - The ehr_uri for the locatable resource 
        + ehr_id: `347a5490-55ee-4da9-b91a-9bba710f730e` (string, optional) - An alternative way to supply the `ehr_id` context (in addition to the `openEHR-EHR-id` request header) needed only for resolving relative EHR-URIs that are constructed relative to the current EHR so that they do not mention the EHR id (see above).

+ Response 200 (application/json) 
    The JSON serialized representation of the locatable. 
    + Body 

            {
                /* JSON representation of the locatable */ 
            }

            XML representation of the locatable

+ Response 404 

            The locatable defined by the ehr_uri (or the ehr_id) was not found.
