== Purpose

This document describes a 'simplified template' (ST) format, along with various JSON concrete data formats, intended to be easier to use than the canonical formats, for typical developers with minimal exposure to openEHR. These formats are designed to enable easier creation of openEHR content (i.e. Compositions etc).

== Status

This specification is in the {spec_status} state. The development version of this document can be found at {json_data_template}[{json_data_template}^].

Known omissions or questions are indicated in the text with a 'to be determined' paragraph, as follows:

*TBD*: (example To Be Determined paragraph)
