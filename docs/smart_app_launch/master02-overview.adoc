The openEHR Reference Model and REST APIs provide a foundation for interoperable applications. For applications to be truly portable between vendors, there is a requirement for uniform authentication and authorization so that apps can be built once and used with multiple vendors.

The SMART on openEHR specification is meant to provide this framework for:

* Application Registration
* Service Discovery
* Authentication and Authorization
* Context selection
* iFrame Embedded Launch
