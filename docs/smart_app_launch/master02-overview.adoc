= Overview

== Requirements
The openEHR Reference Model and REST APIs provide a foundation for interoperable applications. For applications to be truly portable between vendors, there is a requirement for uniform authentication, authorization. 

Many applications also function in the context of a single EHR (or Patient) or an Episode (or Encounter) and “context selection” and “launches” become essential. 

The SMART on openEHR specification is meant to provide this framework for:

* Service Discovery
* Authentication and Authorization
* Launching apps from an EHR "Launcher"
