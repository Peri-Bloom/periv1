= Application Registration

An Application needs to first regester itself with the CDR that it needs to work with. This process involves the following:

- The Application registers with the CDR by providing the appropriate, ID, OAuth2 Scopes, Launch Contexts, Domains, Redirect URLs etc.
- The Application obtains credentials like the Client ID, Client Secret from the CDR for authentication and authorization.

While this process could be formalised and automated using protocols like OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration in the future, the current recommendation is to do this out-of-band in a way that makes sense for the Application Vendor and the CDR Vendor. For example, the CDR vendor could offer a Registration Page that Application Vendors could use to register their applications, and can have an approval and audit mechanism before applications are registered.
